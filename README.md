IMDb to 111movies.com Redirect Tool

This repository hosts a simple tool that helps you easily access movies and TV shows on 111movies.com directly from IMDb pages. It is (in my opinion) possibly the fastest and simplest free movie streaming solution available. Itâ€™s fully free, non-profit and open source. All code is generated by Google Gemini.

How it works:

Userscript: This script runs in your web browser (using the Tampermonkey extension, available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari and Opera). When you're on an IMDb movie or TV show page, it adds a small panel that lets you click a button to instantly redirect to this GitHub Page.

Custom Viewer Website: This website (index.html) is hosted on GitHub Pages. When you visit it with specific movie or TV show IDs, it embeds the corresponding content from 111movies.com. For TV shows, it also provides a handy way to switch between seasons and episodes.

Disclaimer: Due to the simplicity of the code, it does not check how many seasons and episodes are in each show. Both the season and episode slider go from 1-64. You need to know what you want to watch. Or just go one season up and put the episode back to one when an error occurs.

How to use:

Step 1: Download and upload /[IMDb to Custom 111movies.com Viewer Redirect-1.1.user.js](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/imdb-111movies-redirect/blob/main/IMDb%20to%20Custom%20111movies.com%20Viewer%20Redirect-1.1.user.js) to Tampermonkey.

That's it. Now, when you visit any IMDb page, a popup will ask to redirect as Movie or TV Show. Use your best judgement to choose. As I said, seasons and episodes are not checked. Start at S01E01, then S01E02, and continue until an error occurs. Then start over at S02E01.

Highly recommend Firefox + Tampermonkey, as the tool is built for them. Any browser + userscript injector *might* work.

Why did I make this? Because I can.
